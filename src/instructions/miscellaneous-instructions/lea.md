# `LEA`
Load Effective Address

| Instruction  | Description                              |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `LEA r16, m` | Store effective address for `m` in `r16` |
| `LEA r32, m` | Store effective address for `m` in `r32` |
| `LEA r64, m` | Store effective address for `m` in `r64` |

## Description
Computes the effective address of the second operand (the source operand) and stores it in the first operand (destination operand). The source operand is a memory address (offset part) specified with one of the processors addressing modes; the destination operand is a general-purpose register. The address-size and operand-size attributes affect the action performed by this instruction, as shown in the following table. The operand-size attribute of the instruction is determined by the chosen register; the address-size attribute is determined by the attribute of the code segment.

| Operand Size | Address Size | Action Performed                                                                                                                     |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 16           | 16           | 16-bit effective address is calculated and stored in requested 16-bit register destination.                                          |
| 16           | 32           | 32-bit effective address is calculated. The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination.    |
| 32           | 16           | 16-bit effective address is calculated. The 16-bit address is zero-extended and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination. |
| 32           | 32           | 32-bit effective address is calculated and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                                      |

Different assemblers may use different algorithms based on the size attribute and symbolic reference of the source operand.

In 64-bit mode, the instructionâ€™s destination operand is governed by operand size attribute, the default operand size is 32 bits. Address calculation is governed by address size attribute, the default address size is 64-bits. In 64-bit mode, address size of 16 bits is not encodable. See the table below.

| Operand Size | Address Size | Action Performed                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 16           | 32           | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using `0x67` prefix). The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination (using `0x66` prefix).  |
| 16           | 64           | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size). The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination (using `0x66` prefix). |
| 32           | 32           | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using `0x67` prefix) and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                                                          |
| 32           | 64           | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size) and the lower 32 bits of the address are stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                    |
| 64           | 32           | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using `0x67` prefix), zero-extended to 64-bits, and stored in the requested 64-bit register destination (using `REX.W`).               |
| 64           | 64           | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size) and all 64-bits of the address are stored in the requested 64-bit register destination (using `REX.W`).          |

## Operation
`DEST`: first operand\
`SRC`: second operand

### OperandSize = 16
```rust,ignore
if AddressSize == 16 {
    DEST = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 16-bit address
} else if AddressSize == 32 {
    temp = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 32-bit address
    DEST = temp[0..=15]; // 16-bit address
} else if AddressSize == 64 {
    temp = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 64-bit address
    DEST = temp[0..=15]; // 16-bit address
}
```

### OperandSize = 32
```rust,ignore
if AddressSize == 16 {
    temp = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 16-bit address
    DEST = ZeroExtend(temp); // 32-bit address
} else if AddressSize == 32 {
    DEST = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 32-bit address
} else if AddressSize == 64 {
    temp = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 64-bit address
    DEST = temp[0..=31]; // 16-bit address
}
```

### OperandSize = 64
```rust,ignore
if AddressSize == 64 {
    DEST = EffectiveAddress(SRC); // 64-bit address
}
```
