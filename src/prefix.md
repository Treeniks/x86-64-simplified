This is an alternative very opinionated Instruction Set Reference for the x86-64 Architecture.

The goal of this reference is not to be accurate or perfect, thus for any project with stakes, grab the [official Intel x86-64 Software Developer Manual](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-sdm.html).\
Instead, this reference aims at being a simplified and more readable version for Assembler beginners or small hobby projects, leaving out details that usually aren't relevant when working on typical hardware. For example, differentiation between 64bit and 32bit mode is left out.
